## @package fast_grid
## @brief Contains 2D Grid containers that supports useful iterators.
## 
# These classes are faster than those provided in fast_grid. They do not support
# slicing, though.
#
# @code
# grid1 = Grid3D(10, 10, 10, 0)
# grid2 = Grid3D(10, 10, 10, 1)
# grid1[0, 0, 0] = grid2[0, 0, 0]
# grid1[0, 0, 2:6:2] = grid2[0, 0, 4:5]
# grid1[0, 0, ...] = grid2[0, 0, ...]
# grid1[0, ..., 0] = grid2[..., 0, 0]
# grid1[..., ..., ...] = grid2[..., ...., ....]
# @endcode
#
# Slicing does not copy elements - an auxiliary window container is created that delegates 
# further operations to the underlying container.
# Note that assignments to slices from the same object might not behave as espected. 
# Parallel assignment also does not always work as expected.
# For example:
#@code
# grid[..., 0], grid[..., 1] = grid[..., 1], grid[..., 0]
#@endcode
# does not correctly swop two rows, but the following does:
#@code
# grid[..., 0], grid[..., 1] = grid[..., 1].clone(), grid[..., 0].clone()
#@endcode
#Strictly speaking, it is necessary only to clone the one object,
#but it is hard to remember which, so it is better to clone both (?).
# 
#@todo Implement a way to use copy containers instead of window containers'
