# @param dims
#        The dimensions of the grid to return.
# @param period 
#        an integer denoting the size of squares in the grid with the same value. 
#        For instance, if period is set to 2, then the pixels at (0, 0), (0, 1),

# together in the propertions described in the props grid.

# by the parameter t. (This is not necessary - it is to make easier comparissons 
# between this function and the corr function).
